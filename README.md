# Excel Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates my data cleaning skills using a dataset with seven columns: **Date**, **Client**, **Contact**, **Department**, **Payment**, **Revenue**, and **Profit**. Below are the specific cleaning tasks I performed:

### Cleaning Steps
1. **Date Column**
- No issues; data remained unchanged.

2. **Client Column**
- Removed unnecessary text in parentheses (e.g., `(XNAS:AMZN)`) using the **Find and Replace** feature.

3. **Contact Column**
- Standardized names by:
- Removing extra spaces using the **TRIM** function.
- Applying consistent capitalization using the **PROPER** function.

4. **Department Column**
- Split combined values (e.g., `Cloud Tech_Texas`) into separate columns for **Department Name** and **State Name** using the **Text to Columns** option.

5. **Payment and Revenue Columns**
- Replaced blank cells with "Null" using **Find & Select** > **Go To Special**.

6. **Profit Column**
- No issues; data remained unchanged.

### Outcome
This project showcases essential data cleaning techniques in Excel, preparing the dataset for further analysis.
